  * Classify distinct functions of isoforms 
  * Literature-based analysis of experimental evidence for functionally distinct splice isoforms (FDSIs) for over 700 human & mouse genes
  * Result: fewer than 10% of genes have solid experimental evidences of FDSIs.

# Some question

  * Do most genes really have multiple functional isoforms?
  * Given that only 3% of human and 9% of mouse genes have evidence for FDSIs
  * Trying to link FDSIs back to sequence databases: 25/39
  * Isoforms of 1/3 genes mentioned cannot be matched to transcripts in ENSEMBL
