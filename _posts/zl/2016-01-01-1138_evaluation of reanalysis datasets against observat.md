## What they did?

>   * They evaluated 4 reanalysis datasets, **ERA-Interim/Land, MERRA-2, NCEP-
> CFSR, GLDAS-2.0** , with a focus on **40 cm** soil layer.
>
>   * **Spatial distribution** of soil temperature in summer and winter.
>
>   * Spatial distribution of **linear trend** in summer and winter.
>
>   * Soil temperature **memory** in summer and winter.
