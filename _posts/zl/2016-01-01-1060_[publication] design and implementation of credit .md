We introduce Collie，an online platform to assess the quality of nursing home
service powered by machine learning, which enables user to choose a serial of
selected algorithms for different demand. Previous research has proposed the
point on how to measure the quality of nursing home service. But traditional
service relies on manual investigation which present serval problems like the
process of rating quality is complex and insufficient. For the above problems,
Collie focus on supporting users to assess the quality of nursing home
service. Within the service assessment, we develop a serial of algorithms to
deal with different dataset. But more importantly, different database has
different features, a group of algorithms is not enough to fulfill users
demand. Therefore, we propose a system which enables users choose highly
competitive algorithms to solve their problem. To support the core idea, we
provide a high performance infrastructure features asynchronous I/O, fast and
error tolerant data pipeline. Through a series of experiments, we show that
our system outperforms the baseline significantly in terms of system
performance, algorithm accuracy. Promising result has been retrieved from our
algorithm which indices MAE of 0.5 at sample dataset.
